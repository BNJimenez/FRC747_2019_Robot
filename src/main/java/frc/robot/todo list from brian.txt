 - Tidy up wiring up top
 - Run encoder wires to bottom
 - Finish latch mechanism
 - Mount RSL
 
 
 CODE
  - Ramp down
  
  
  DONE:
  - tongue
  - dart - done, ask felipe if he wants on Y button or if he wants the shitty joysticks - if he chooses stick then copy of shfitdrive with axis values acting as a button when passed a threshold value.
  - vision track button
  - commented out dart home toggle in OI on A button
  
  
  in OI - start command whileHeld
  in ClimbCommand - EITHER LEFT OR RIGHT BUMPER will drive the latch PID loop, other will do the winches and climb = 100%
  tune rampdown
  test autoshift
  potentially find new angle for limelight IF REQUIRED angle might be required to keep track of target for a longer time as we approach target
  clean up code, delete old shite and make it neat;
  
  
  
  pid open
  
  init
  set pos
  
  execute 
  
  end 
  bool = true
  
  
  climb
  
  if(bumper && bool) {
  climb
  }
  
  
  climbCommand no longer default TAKE IT OUT OF THE DEFAULT
  startButton.whileHeld(climbcommand)
  
  IN CLIMB COMMAND;
  execute (
  If aBumper && !bool
	drivePIDLatch
  }
  
  Check for pos
  if pos is within threshold use > and <
  bool = true
  else: bool = false
  
  if bool && otherBumper
	climb.set(1.0)
	
	
	
	
	driverStation putBoolean
